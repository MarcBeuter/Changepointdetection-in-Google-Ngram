Extraction of Noticeable Data from Google Ngram

Different methods to extract interesting Data from Google Ngram

Initializing

To Initialize the tool, you must run the tool once, so it creates the necessary directories.
Then you have to add the files from Google Ngram (http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html)
into the NewFileInput-Directory (either in zipped or unzipped form). You do not have to
add all files at the beginning, if you do not need them. Files can always be added at a
later time. Run the tool again with '-import' as run-parameter to process the added files.

Then you are free to start using the tool. For more information on the available commands 
use the '-help' parameter. There are different modes and also different ways to calculate
interesting points.

Modes:

-points(standard) calculates and prints the interesting points of all terms
-similar calculates the interesting points of the first term and finds other terms 
	with similar interesting points
	in case more than one term are given calculates the similarity of all terms to
	the first term
-years finds all terms with interesting points at the given years
